        Description: This program takes a series of integers from the user-- asking for a number, then asking if the user would like to enter one more. It
        displays all the negative numbers and their sum to the screen, then displays all the positive numbers and their sum to the screen.

        /* Algorithm
        1. Get input and format into an array

        3. Find the total amount of positives and negatives from their respective arrays
        4. Output the negative integers in a formatted way
        5. Output the positive integers in a formatted way
