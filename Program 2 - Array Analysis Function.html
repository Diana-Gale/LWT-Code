        Description: This program takes a number and searches an array for the number of occurences. It then prints the number of occurences, the array it searched
        through, and the number to search for to the screen in a formatted manner.

        var numArray = the parameter that signifies the array to search through in the function countOccurences. it is used in the for loop in the function. 
        var searchNum = the number to search for, that is entered into the function countOccurences.
